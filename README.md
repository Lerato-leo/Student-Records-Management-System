# Student Records Management System

## Project Overview
This project is a Student Records Management System designed to manage student information, course enrollments, grades, and attendance using a relational database and Python-based ETL pipelines with an advanced CLI interface.

The project follows a phased, end-to-end data engineering approach aligned with the IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate.

## Current Status
**Phase 8 – CLI Enhancement & PDF Export (COMPLETED ✓)** 
- Enhanced CLI with Delete operations (with confirmation prompts)
- Added Search functionality (students by name/number, records by ID)
- Implemented Pagination (5 items per page with navigation)
- Added Sorting capabilities (by student number, first name, last name)
- Integrated PDF export with ReportLab (3 report types)
- Enhanced PDF styling with professional formatting, headers, footers
- Updated documentation with new features
- All PDFs generating successfully with professional appearance

**All 8 Phases Completed** ✅

**Latest Commit:** `be9e769` (PDF Export & Documentation)

## Project Phases

### ✓ Phase 1: Schema Design
- Conceptual and logical data modeling
- Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) created
- Normalized schema (3NF) designed

### ✓ Phase 2: Database Setup & Table Creation
- PostgreSQL database created
- Tables created with constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, CHECK)
- Data types and constraints enforced

### ✓ Phase 3: Sample Data Generation & ETL Pipeline
**Sample Data Generation**
- Python script generates realistic sample data using Faker
- 100 students with unique 6-digit numbers (YYYYRR format)
- 15 courses with standard academic curriculum
- 200 enrollments linking students to courses
- 400 grade records with values 0-100
- 1000 attendance records with timestamps
- All CSV files saved with comma delimiters

**ETL Pipeline (Python)**
- **Extract:** Reads all 5 CSV files using pandas
- **Transform:** 
  - Validates all required columns and data types
  - Ensures status values are lowercase (active, inactive, graduated)
  - Validates grade values (0-100 range)
  - Validates enrollment terms (1 or 2)
  - Validates grade types (test, assignment, exam)
  - Removes duplicates by unique constraints
  - Fixes academic_year format (YYYY-YYYY+1)
  - Converts attendance_date to proper timestamps
  - **Foreign Key Validation:** Ensures all referenced IDs exist in parent tables
  - Removes invalid rows to maintain referential integrity
- **Load:** 
  - Clears existing tables safely using DROP CASCADE
  - Inserts data in correct dependency order: students → courses → enrollments → grades → attendance
  - Handles errors gracefully with try/except blocks
- **Data Quality:**
  - 97 valid students inserted
  - 15 courses inserted
  - 195 valid enrollments (5 invalid removed)
  - 392 valid grades (8 invalid removed)
  - 971 valid attendance records (29 invalid removed)

### ✓ Phase 5: SQL Queries & Procedures
**Advanced SQL Development**
- Created 3 database views:
  - `vw_student_transcripts` - Student course history with grades
  - `vw_course_rosters` - Course enrollment lists
  - `vw_attendance_reports` - Attendance tracking by student
- Implemented 5 SQL functions:
  - `get_students_by_course(course_id)` - List students in a course
  - `get_course_grade_statistics(course_id)` - Grade distribution and averages
  - `get_low_attendance_students(threshold)` - Identify attendance issues
  - `get_top_students_by_gpa(limit)` - Rank students by academic performance
  - `get_enrollment_statistics()` - Overall enrollment insights
- Built 3 stored procedures with validation:
  - `add_student_enrollment()` - Enroll student with duplicate checking
  - `record_grade()` - Insert grades with 0-100 range validation
  - `mark_attendance()` - Record attendance with timestamp
- **Status:** Tested on live PostgreSQL ✓ (Commit: a0dc407)

## Tech Stack
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 12+ (16+ recommended)
- **Backend/ETL:** Python 3.8+ (tested with 3.11.9)
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy 2.0
- **PDF Generation:** ReportLab 4.4.9
- **Testing:** pytest 7.4+
- **Data Generation:** Faker 20.1
- **Data Processing:** pandas 2.1
- **Version Control:** Git/GitHub

## Database Design
The database is designed using a normalized schema (3NF) with the following core entities:
- **Students** - Student profiles with unique student numbers
- **Courses** - Course catalog with course codes
